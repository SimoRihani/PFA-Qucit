App is a cross-platform mobile application, developed by 6 computer science students from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][], 
a French Engineering School in Bordeaux.

The purpose of App is redirecting users in the transportation failures on the Bordeaux-Metropole network.
Its has been developed for a start-up incubated in the [Aquitaine Regional Incubator][] called [Qucit][].

App is available for all platforms supported by the [Apache Cordova][] framework but actually only tested on iOS and Android.

##Installation

First, you need to get Cordova, with npm : npm install -g cordova or download it from the website.
And also, you have to install the [Android SDK][] to build android App version, or [Xcode][] to build for iOS.

	cd pfa29_client/
	chmod 700 install.sh

	cd pfa29_client/
	cordova create qucit com.debug.qucit App
	rm -r qucit/www/
	mv qucit/* .
	rm -r qucit/

Add the platforms you need, for example iOS and Android :
