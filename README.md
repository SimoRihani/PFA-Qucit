# Qucit - Transport Track ![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-ios%20%7C%20android-lightgrey.svg)

Transport Track is a cross-platform mobile application, developed by 6 computer science students from [Bordeaux-INP][] [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][], 
a French Engineering School in Bordeaux.

The purpose of Transport Track is redirecting users in the transportation failures on Bordeaux-Metropole network.
Its has been developed for a start-up incubated in the [Aquitaine Regional Incubator][] called [Qucit][].

Transport Track is available for all platforms supported by the [Apache Cordova][] framework but actually only tested on iOS and Android.

The client side is developed with [Polymer][] and [Material Design][] Google frameworks, and the back-end with Python through [Flask][] and [Pandas][] frameworks.

This project involves [Web Components][] in the client side, and [BI][] (Business inteligence) using some [Machine Learning][] algorithms in the transportation failures treatment (classification).

##Installation

First, you need to get [Apache Cordova][], with [npm][] : `npm install -g cordova` or download it from the website.
And also, you have to install the [Android SDK][] to build android Transport Track version, or [Xcode][] to build it for iOS.
(Think to include the SDK's `tools/` and `platform-tools/` directories  in your `PATH` after installing Android SDK (here's a link that can help you doing these installations : https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide/platforms/android/ ))

Clone Qucit - Transport Track with `git clone https://github.com/piroux/pfa29_client`

####Auto install :

Run the install.sh script :

	cd PFA-Qucit/
	chmod 700 install.sh
	./install.sh

####Manual install :

Run the following :

	cd PFA-Qucit/
	cordova create qucit com.debug.qucit Transport Track
	rm -r qucit/www/
	mv qucit/* .
	rm -r qucit/

Add the platforms you need, for example iOS and Android :

	cordova platform add ios
	cordova platform add android

and other supported platforms if you want.

Build it with `cordova build` or just run it on your device  with `cordova run android` and/or `cordova run ios`.

####Overview on your browser :

If you want to have an overview of Transport Track on your browser, run the following :

	cd PFA-Qucit/www/
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
	
You can see the result in your browser by going to your localhost on port 8080 : `localhost:8080`

##Get Transport Track
